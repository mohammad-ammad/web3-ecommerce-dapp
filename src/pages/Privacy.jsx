            <p className='text-sm text-slate-700 leading-7 mt-2 text-justify'>
                Some of our services offer mobile or browser applications to allow you to take advantage of our service offerings on the go and/or when visiting third-party websites and other online services.  Certain of these applications also allow us to access more precise Location Data about you and collect information about your use and interactions with third-party websites and online services (including the products or services you are interested in or purchase) to better serve you.
                We, and our third-party partners such as Snap (through the use of the SnapCamera Kit to power the features of the AR technology) and Apple (through the use of the TrueDepth camera to improve the quality of the lenses), may also collect metadata included in the photos and images that you upload, such as your device model, camera type, camera settings (e.g. ISO, shutter, focal length, lens, aperture), image information (e.g. format, file size, date and time, resolution) or location data (e.g. geotagging). Our third-party partners such as Snap Inc. (we use CameraKit SDK from Snap Inc.) may also use information from Apple’s TrueDepth camera to improve the quality of Lenses. Information from the TrueDepth camera is used in real time — Snap Inc. doesn't store this information on their servers or share it with third parties.
